# Open Media Pictograms for HMI

This directory contains all of the pictograms I created and used in my own HMI software.  
  
If you want to use them with yours, or with another software, you are able to include them for free, and the only thing you have to do is mention the original copyright in your description and also use the same license.  
  
All of these contents are provided for free, so you can enjoy them as you want, but let it free.
